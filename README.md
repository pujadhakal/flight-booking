Webscraping to know the best flights compairing the best possible prices and best possible routes.

This mini project involves creating a flight recommendation system for users planning a trip from Helsinki to a chosen city.

The project unfolds in four sequential steps. Initially, a destination city with a minimum of 50 available flights is selected, and relevant flight data is scraped from three booking websites, such as booking.com, Kayak.com, and Momondo.com. Challenges in web scraping are addressed, and strategies for efficient storage of the collected data are discussed. The subsequent step involves processing the data to create a clean and usable dataset for further analysis. Employing appropriate visualization methods, the third step focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to glean insights into various flight parameters like prices, stops, airlines, and durations. The final step introduces user interaction, allowing users to input preferences and receive a sorted list of flights based on their criteria. The code also enables users to specify departure times, maximum travel durations, and preferred airlines to obtain details on the cheapest and fastest flights, including layovers and aircraft types. 

The scientific report accompanying the project covers the introduction, data collection methodology, analysis techniques, and a reflective conclusion on scientific challenges faced and overcome. Overall, the project aims to showcase proficiency in web scraping, data processing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of an interactive flight recommendation system.
